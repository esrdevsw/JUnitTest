<p>Programme Name: InsuranceProgram</p>

<p>The JUnit automated tests that were developed for this project have the capability to test the Java application Old_InsuranceProgram.java, which calculates the car insurance premium based on age. 

The code has been refactored into well-defined classes to enable JUnit5 testing. A set of tests has been created using annotations such as @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @Test, @ParameterizedTest, @Timeout, @AfterAll, @AfterEach, and two different types of exceptions. The automated test suite set for the InsuranceProgram conforms to the convention with the respective folder containing the tests. </p>

<p>The structure of the files conforms to the convention. The tests are found in the respective folder.</p>
